# Advent of IntCode

Welcome to my Advent of IntCode 2021 adventure!

Go **[here](https://relativisticturtle.github.io/intcode-adventure-2021)** to listen to the story of how I solve the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)-problems with algorithms implemented in IntCode.

The larger part of the telling will be on the tool I wrote for the purpose: an IntCode-compiler, if you will. I'll try to describe its design, beginning at a basic level, and advancing to the fully functional tool. I do this in the hope that it may demystify how compilers transform human-readable code to machine-instructions.

I have never coded anything resembling a compiler before. However, from curiosity and general interest in computer science I had a (*very*) vague idea of what one was supposed to do. I challenged myself to write this tool myself because, you know... er... fun?

So, to be clear:

This is *not* a HOWTO on writing quality compilers (or *any* quality code for that matter...).

This is my IntCode-adventure of 2021!
