# Prologue - It begins (again)

The space-shuttle hits the water surface with a huge splash and you draw a sigh of relief. Finally! You close your eyes for a moment and reminiscence over the last two years. What an adventure, going on that desperate rescue-mission, all the way to the outer solar system, finding Santa in his stranded spaceship. And how unfortunate that Santa left for Earth, with your hard-earned 50 stars, while you were busy playing [Breakout](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13) on your ship’s arcade cabinet. And that the ship became infested by [Erisian bugs](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/24). And that you lost yourself in the [Plutonian maze](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/20) while looking for the bathroom. And being put in [Space Jail](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/11) for exceeding local speed of light limit.

All-in-all [this little maneuver has cost you ~~51~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GdEsdEfZvc) 2 years, and the date is again Dec 1st. What coincidence... You shrug a sense of foreboding away and glance over your shoulder at the IntCode-machine, "``I2C2``" as you have fondly begun to refer to it, sitting tightly secured in the backseat. Though now irrevocably dead since the Erisian bug-infestation, ``I2C2`` has been your faithful servant… no: your friend and savior during the Santa-hunting days, and you don’t abandon your friend in space (as a certain someone did...). Replacing all the thousands of wires the bugs have eaten and the relay switches they have gotten squished in would be a herculean task, but: *you don’t abandon your friend in space!*

Pulling yourself together you switch on the radio to contact the Elves.

"Millenium Penguin to North pole. Millenium Penguin to North pole. Do you copy? Over."

Silence. Maybe the Elves have switched to frequency-hopping communication? You start to twist the radio’s frequency dial back-and-forth until you pick up a faint signal from one of the Elves nearby ships.

"*bzzz… could not help that I tripped …bzzz… and who even put their dark olive bag there? …bzzz…. [policy](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7) dictates that they should always be stowed in a shiny gold bag.*"

"Millenium Penguin to the Elf-ship. Millenium Penguin to the Elf-ship. Do you copy? Over."

"*bzzz… the problem remains …bzzz… you dropped the only set …bzzz… sleigh keys …bzzz… the deepest part of the ocean …bzzz… Hey, did someone just call us on the Elfcrypted radio channel?*"

"Millenium Penguin to the Elf-ship. It’s me. I’m back. The reentry was turbulent, but I landed safely. How long until you pick me up?"

"*bzzz… what? who are you? anyone knows …bzzz… is talking about?*"

"Come on, you know me. You sent me to rescue Santa when he was stranded in space two years ago. I just landed in this ocean. Didn’t you track me?"

"*bzzz… did we send anyone to space? …bzzz… ah that! had almost forgotten …bzzz… wasn’t it supposed to be a one-way trip?*"

"So, are you coming to pick me up now?"

"*bzzz… a moment …bzzz… urgent situation on our hands …bzzz… no submarine and …bzzz… where can we find a volunteer …bzzz…*"

"*bzzz… just had a great idea! …bzzz… this schematic of the space capsule …bzzz… minor modifications needed.*"

"*bzzz… are you still there? we are coming to pick you up now.*"

Two hours later you descend into the darkness with the re-purposed Millenium Penguin. The Elves have briefed you on the details of the situation and generously volunteered you for this important mission. Among the equipment hastily installed onboard is a star-powered key-finding antenna, Christmas lights ("*they might come in handy!*"), and still in the backseat sits the IntCode-machine silent, waiting.

"I guess it’s you and me again, ``I2C2``."

You find a box of (*thousands*) spare cables and relay switches and get to work, praying that you *did* manage to cleanse ``I2C2`` from bugs.

"Let’s go on an Adventure!"
