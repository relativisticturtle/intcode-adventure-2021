# Welcome to Advent of IntCode 2021!

Two years in space. Lost, abandoned, forgotten... but the Astronaut did *not* give up.

Against all odds (and Erisian bugs (and the space police)), the Astronaut has made a heroic return!

Now glory and celebration befitting a hero awaits our adventurer from 2019!

...except in the extremely unlikely case of a [sleigh-key dropping accident](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)...

The ~~Astronaut~~ Aquanaut embarks on a new adventure!
