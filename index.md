# Welcome to Advent of IntCode 2021!

On these pages I shall tell the story of how I solve the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)-problems with algorithms implemented in IntCode.

To this end I prepared a tool, an IntCode-compiler, to generate the IntCode-program from a made-up C language imitation ("C lite"). For me this was a first. I have never coded anything resembling a compiler before. However, from curiosity and general interest in computer science I had a (*very*) vague idea of what one was supposed to do. I challenged myself to write this tool myself because, you know... er... fun? And just in time for this year's round of AoC the pieces came together and I tried it on the day 1 puzzles. Moment of truth. One star. Two stars. It works! It actually works!

So, to be clear:

This is *not* a HOWTO on writing quality compilers (or quality code in general...).

This is my IntCode-adventure of 2021!
